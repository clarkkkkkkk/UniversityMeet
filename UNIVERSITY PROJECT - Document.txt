UNIVERSITY PROJECT

Day 1: 

How to plan coding projects

- Sketch the draw of website look
- Stacks want to use - Front/Back/Database
- Understand the file structure

I do: 
- Create Repo on GitHub
- Setting up environment 
- Analyzing / Implementing Tech Stacks


Tech Stacks 

Front-End:
React.JS
Back-End:
Node.JS


Day 2:

Guide from AI, Project Description:

UniConnect – Real-Time Classroom & Meeting Platform
Project Description

Guide me like an experienced developer, providing advice, best practices, architecture decisions, and technical solutions to successfully complete this project.

UniConnect is a real-time classroom and virtual meeting platform inspired by Google Meet and Google Classroom. It is built using React + TypeScript (Vite) on the client side and Node.js, Express, and Socket.io on the server side. The platform enables users to join dynamic rooms, stream video/audio, and communicate in real time using WebRTC peer connections with Socket.io-based signaling.

UniConnect is designed for online classes, meetings, and collaborative environments where multiple participants interact in shared virtual spaces.

Auto-detection of peer join/leave
Smooth media streaming optimized for low latency

2. Room Management

Create or join rooms with custom Room IDs
Track active participants inside each room
Notify all users when a new participant enters
Automatically remove users when they disconnect
Simple & intuitive interface for room selection

3. Local Media Handling

Automatic camera and microphone access
